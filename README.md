Configuration examples
Minimal config (YAML)
This sample shows a compact config for a single-node install. Adjust values for your environment.
```yaml
controller:
  bind: 0.0.0.0:8080
  data_dir: /var/lib/backupcopy/controller

engine:
  max_workers: 8
  temp_dir: /var/lib/backupcopy/engine/tmp

store:
  type: filesystem
  path: /var/backups/backupcopy
  retention_days: 30
```

S3 store example
```yaml
store:
  type: s3
  endpoint: s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
  bucket: backupcopy-main
  access_key: AKIA...
  secret_key: ***
  region: us-west-2
  encryption: aes-256
```

Policy example
Define schedules and retention.
```yaml
policies:
  - name: daily-vm
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"       # daily at 02:00
    targets:
      - vm-group: production
    retention:
      keep_daily: 7
      keep_weekly: 4
      keep_monthly: 12
```

Backup workflow
1. Discovery
   - Controller queries hypervisor or cloud API.
   - It lists VMs and attached volumes.
2. Policy assignment
   - Controller assigns a policy to each VM or group.
   - Policy defines schedule, retention, and verification rules.
3. Snapshot
   - Engine triggers a snapshot.
   - For hypervisors, the provider snapshot API executes.
   - For agent-based capture, the agent freezes I/O briefly then flushes filesystem buffers.
4. Transfer
   - Engine reads snapshot blocks.
   - It applies dedupe filter.
   - It streams unique blocks to the store.
5. Commit and index
   - Engine writes metadata and indexes blocks.
   - Controller marks the job complete and records the manifest.

Instant VM recovery workflow
Instant recovery minimizes downtime by running a VM directly from a backup image. The workflow below shows the usual steps.

1. Select a recovery point
   - Use the UI or CLI to pick a backup manifest.
2. Provision a mount
   - Recovery agent exports the backup image via NBD or iSCSI.
3. Attach to host
   - The hypervisor attaches the exported target as a datastore or disk.
4. Boot the VM
   - Start the VM from the attached image.
5. Spin-up with read-redirect
   - Reads go to the mounted image.
   - Writes go to a write-redirect overlay.
6. Rehydrate data
   - Engine streams missing blocks back to primary storage in the background.
   - When rehydration completes, you can cut over to the primary storage.

Restore modes and granular restore
BackupCopy supports several restore modes:
- Full VM restore
  - Restore a complete VM image.
  - Use for lost machines or major failures.
- Instant run-from-backup
  - Boot VM from backup image with write-redirect overlay.
- Volume-level restore
  - Restore an individual disk or volume.
- File-level restore
  - Mount the backup image and extract files.
- Application item restore
  - For supported apps, restore single items like mailboxes and databases.

CLI reference
The CLI uses the backupcopy command. Use it for scripted workflows and automation.

Common commands
- backupcopy job run --policy daily-vm --targets vm-123
  - Start a job immediately for a given policy and target.
- backupcopy jobs list --status completed
  - List job runs and their status.
- backupcopy restores create --vm vm-123 --point 2025-08-10T02:00Z
  - Create a restore job for the given VM and recovery point.
- backupcopy instant start --vm vm-123 --point latest
  - Start instant VM recovery for the specified VM.
- backupcopy stores add --type s3 --bucket backupcopy-main
  - Add a new store backend.

Example: create a scheduled job
```bash
backupcopy policy create --name weekly-snap --schedule "0 3 * * 0" --targets "vm-group:db"
backupcopy job run --policy weekly-snap
```

  - List discovered VMs.
- POST /api/v1/backups
  - Trigger a backup job.
  - Body: { "vm_id": "...", "policy": "..." }
- GET /api/v1/backups/{id}
  - Get backup manifest.

Restore endpoints
- POST /api/v1/restores
  - Start a restore.
  - Body: { "backup_id": "...", "mode": "full|instant|file" }
- POST /api/v1/instant/start
  - Launch instant recovery.

Monitoring endpoints
- GET /api/v1/metrics
  - Return internal metrics in Prometheus format.
- GET /api/v1/health
  - Service health and status.

Integration and plugins
BackupCopy integrates with common virtualization and cloud platforms:
- VMware vSphere
  - Use the vSphere plugin for snapshot and datastore actions.
- KVM/libvirt
  - Use qemu-img and libvirt snapshots.
- Hyper-V
  - Integrate with VSS-aware agents.
- Cloud providers
  - AWS, Azure, and GCP connectors for metadata and compute actions.
- Storage systems
  - NFS, CIFS, S3-compatible object stores, and block storage.
- Orchestration
  - Hooks for Kubernetes operators and Terraform providers.

Plugin model
- Each plugin provides:
  - Discovery logic
  - Snapshot flow
  - Restore hooks
  - Health checks

Security and encryption
BackupCopy secures data in transit and at rest.

Transport encryption
- TLS protects controller and engine traffic.
- mTLS is available for node-to-node links.

At-rest encryption
- Store-level encryption uses AES-256.
- Keys can come from an external KMS or from local keystore.

Access control
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for the web UI and API.
- Scopes for read-only, backup, restore, and admin functions.

Secrets handling
- The controller integrates with external secret stores.
- Do not store plaintext credentials in config files.

Retention, verification, and auditing
Retention
- Policies drive retention rules.
- BackupCopy supports retention windows, GFS (grandfather-father-son), and custom rule sets.

Verification
- Background verification boots test VMs on a schedule.
- The engine runs checksum and manifest validation.
- Built-in boot tests verify OS-level readiness.

Auditing
- The controller logs actions to an audit log.
- It records user actions, job runs, and policy changes.
- Send audit logs to a centralized SIEM via syslog.

Performance and tuning
Sizing guidance
- Throughput depends on engine workers and store IO.
- Use multiple engines for parallelism.
- Use fast temp storage for dedupe tables.

Tuning knobs
- engine.max_workers controls parallel streams.
- store.concurrent_uploads controls parallel uploads to object storage.
- engine.read_block_size sets block read size for snapshots.

Network considerations
- Use dedicated replication networks.
- Enable WAN acceleration for cross-site transfers.
- Use compression for low-bandwidth links.

Deduplication behavior
- Inline dedupe reduces network and store load.
- Use chunker settings to balance dedupe ratio vs CPU.
- Configure a dedupe fingerprint cache to speed repeat reads.

Testing and validation
Test plan
- Run scheduled verification jobs on non-production VMs.
- Boot restored VMs in isolated networks to exercise full boot paths.
- Validate application listeners and DB consistency.

Validation checklist
- Verify backup manifest integrity.
- Verify full metadata index is available.
- Test file-level restores.
- Test instant recovery and cutover.

Sample validation commands
- backupcopy verify run --backup-id 1234
- backupcopy instant test --vm vm-123 --point latest

Monitoring and alerting
Metrics
- Expose metrics to Prometheus:
  - backup_jobs_total
  - backup_duration_seconds
  - restore_jobs_total
  - store_upload_bytes
  - dedupe_ratio

Alert rules
- Alert on failed jobs > 3 within 24 hours.
- Alert on low available storage below threshold.
- Alert on replication lag exceeding policy RPO.

Logging
- Engine and controller log to local files by default.
- Forward logs to a central logging system (ELK, Fluentd).
- Keep rotation rules to control disk use.

Troubleshooting checklist
- Job fails on snapshot
  - Check hypervisor connectivity.
  - Check agent status on the VM if agent-based quiesce runs.
- Slow backup throughput
  - Check engine CPU and temp I/O.
  - Check network saturation.
  - Review dedupe ratio and chunk settings.
- Restore fails to boot
  - Check target host compatibility.
  - Verify disk bus type and drivers.
- Instant recovery I/O errors
  - Check recovery agent logs.
  - Verify NBD/iSCSI connectivity and timeouts.
- Replication lag
  - Check store backend health.
  - Check per-job throttle limits.

```

Kubernetes operator integration
- Use the BackupCopy operator to:
  - Discover PVs
  - Snapshot PVCs
  - Trigger backup jobs for pods

Example custom resource
```yaml
apiVersion: backupcopy.io/v1
kind: BackupJob
metadata:
  name: app-backup
spec:
  schedule: "0 1 * * *"
  targets:
    - kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      name: data-pvc
  retention:
    keep_daily: 7
```

Why test restores matters
A backup that does not restore offers no protection. Test restore runs validate the entire stack: snapshot creation, data indexing, export, and VM or file-level access. Schedule these tests alongside production backups to ensure recoverability.

Common errors and remedies
- Error: snapshot timeout
  - Remedy: increase snapshot timeout in hypervisor plugin settings.
- Error: dedupe memory exhaustion
  - Remedy: increase engine memory or reduce dedupe cache size.
- Error: permission denied writing to store
  - Remedy: verify credentials and bucket policies.
